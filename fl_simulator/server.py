# defines the server object

# keeps model weights
# can initialize the model weights
# keeps a list of the clients, together with their weights, can add or remove clients from the list
    # I think we shoudl keep weights because it also includes the binary case using weights 0 and 1 (picking or not picking a client)
# can send the weights to clients
# can wait for the updates from the clients
# has its own test data set, under the syntetic_data folder
# upon receiving the updates, can send them to the client selection algorithms, to update the weights of the clients
# also, upon receiving the updates, can aggregate them with respect to client's weights
